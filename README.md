# Who-will-survive?- Titanic

Group Project

## Introduction
Titanic, a British passenger liner, sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking at the time one of the deadliest of a single ship and the deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship to date. This project allows us to gain insight into how to survive from such a catastrophe, is it pure luck or is it something else?

## Dataset
The “tantanic” file contains the dataset to be used for this project. The dataset is already splitted into training and testing sets.
Here are the definitions of the some of the variables:
Survival - 0 = No, 1 = Yes
pclass(Ticket class) - 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
Sibsp - # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch - # of parents / children aboard the Titanic
Embarked - port of embarkation - C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
